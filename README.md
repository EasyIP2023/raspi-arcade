## Parts
This project in total cost me around $350 largely due to the fact that I needed extra tools and I am making two.

# Creating
## Building/Shaping The Frame

1. Take your 1/2 2 by 4 Wood and draw 4 circles with a radius of 5". The diameter should be about 10".

![Board With Circles](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181214_200639.jpg)

2. Using the [RYOBI Jig Saw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-18-Volt-ONE-Orbital-Jig-Saw-Tool-Only-P5231/301916606) cut the board into 4 circles of equal size.
3. Clean Workspace!!!!! :)
4. Take the 8 * 9" Traditional Leg (Pierna Tradicional) and cut off the tip to shorten height of case. I did this because my coper wires weren't going to reach the pi.

![4 Circles and Pillars](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181214_213226.jpg)

5. Clean Workspace!!!!! :)
6. Use the [dermel tool](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dremel-200-Series-1-15-Amp-Dual-Speed-Corded-Rotary-Tool-Kit-with-15-Accessories-and-1-Attachment-200-1-15/202349458) to shape wood and make edges smooth.

**README: At the time I should of thought of cutting the button holes before cutting holes for the 4 pillars. That way you can position your pillars based off the orientation of the buttons not the other way around**

7. For both bottom plates insert 4 holes. Two on the left about 1 1/4" from the circles edge and about a little less than 4" apart. The right two holes need to be about 1" from the circles edge and about 6 1/2" apart. **Note When doing this, most of these measurements are just eye balled**. The reason you need to make 4 holes is because the traditional leg has a screw at the bottom all you need to do is screw it in.

![4 Holes](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181215_032258.jpg)

**This is how it should look**

![Top Pillars](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181215_032602.jpg)

8. Now draw the 8 button + joystick layout on the wood. I put the pillars on, flipped it over and just eyeballed it. So my button measurements aren't accurate.
  * Used a 5/8 spade bit to cut the joystick hole
  * Used a 1 1/8 spade bit to cut the buttons

![1 1/8 Spade Bit](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181217_144101.jpg)
![Holes Cut](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181215_215323.jpg)

9. Now that the buttons are cut. Use the dermal tool to shape a rectangular hole. Achieved by outlining the joystick. So, that you have room to maneuver the joystick remember the wood is a 1/2 2 by 4.

![Button Holder](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181216_181323.jpg)

10. Grab one of your button holders and outline each button. After using the dermal tool shape holes so that the button holders fit between them. **NOTE IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PERFECT!!! PARTS 8-10 TOOK ME LONG OF TIME!!!!**
11. Take your joystick and insert it into the joystick holder. Draw each edge circling the holes where your 8 - 32 * 1 - 1/2 inch screws would be inserted. To drill the holes use a 3/16 inch drill bit.

## Paint

Remove the traditional legs and paint all 4 plates both sides using the Semi-Gloss Glidden Red 2 coat Paint (GLN6413N). I decided to add 4 coats to the top and 3 at the bottom of each plate for a total of 14 coats. I let it dry over night. After the next morning I inserted buttons holders.

## Carving Name

After paint has dried carve button letters into plates using the dermal tool.

# Installing

1. Download [retro pie](https://retropie.org.uk/download/) for whatever version of the pie you have.
2. I used [dd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dd) to install it on my micro USB, but you can use anything you want. ```gunzip -c /path/to/retropie.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb```
3. Use a keyboard configure retropie
  * hit F4 once loaded
  * [Configure your keyboard](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/25556740-changing-the-raspberry-pi-keyboard-layout) making is US if need be
  * Configure wifi
    - ```sudo -s```
    - ```wpa_passphrase "ssid" "password" >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf```
  * Install vim ```sudo apt install vim```
  * Enable ssh access on reboots. Can remove it later
    - ```sudo systemctl enable ssh.service```
  * Download and install [Adafruit retropie config](https://learn.adafruit.com/retro-gaming-with-raspberry-pi/adding-controls-software). It'll ask if you want to reboot. Do so!
    - ```cd```
    - ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/retrogame.sh > retrogame.sh```
    - ```chmod +x retrogame.sh```
    - ```sudo ./retrogame.sh```
  * Using vim update the [/boot/retrogame.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/master/retrogame.cfg) to look like mine.
    - I used GPIO pin 12 as the Left Shoulder button and the GND right next to it
    - I made GPIO pin 13 as the Right Shoulder button and 20 as GND.
  * Make sure audio goes through hdmi
    - Inside the /boot/config.txt file uncomment the line with ```hdmi_drive=2```
    - Here's a [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9tQPNwk8M) to help if you have any other audio related issues
  * Change passwords
    - ```sudo -s```
    - ```passwd``` to change root password
    - ```passwd pi``` to change pi's password
4. Installing Roms
  * I labeled the names of the folder that you should scp these [Roms](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/tree/master/games) into. You can download more games here at [gamulator.com](https://www.gamulator.com/roms) at your leisure
  * **Example:** ```scp games/snes/* pi@<ip address>:/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/snes```
