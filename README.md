## Parts
This project in total cost me around $300 largely due to the fact that I needed extra tools and I am making two.

# Creating
## Building/Shaping The Frame

1. Take your 1/2 2 by 4 Wood and draw 4 circles with a radius of 5". The diameter should be about 10".

![Board With Circles](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181214_200639.jpg)

2. Using the [RYOBI Jig Saw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-18-Volt-ONE-Orbital-Jig-Saw-Tool-Only-P5231/301916606) cut the board into 4 circles of equal size.
3. Clean Workspace!!!!! :)
4. Take the 8 * 9" Traditional Leg (Pierna Tradicional) and cut off the tip to shorten height of case. I did this because my coper wires weren't going to reach the pi.

![4 Circles and Pillars](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181214_213226.jpg)

5. Clean Workspace!!!!! :)
6. Use the [dermel tool](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dremel-200-Series-1-15-Amp-Dual-Speed-Corded-Rotary-Tool-Kit-with-15-Accessories-and-1-Attachment-200-1-15/202349458) to shape wood and make edges smooth.
7. For both bottom plates insert 4 holes. Two on the left about 1 1/4" from the circles edge and about a little less than 4" apart. The right two holes need to be about 1" from the circles edge and about 6 1/2" apart. **Note When doing this most of these measurements. I just eye balled**. The reason you need to make 4 holes is because the traditional leg has a screw at the bottom all you need to do is screw it in.

**This is how it should look**

8. Now draw the 8 button + joystick layout on the wood. I put the pillars on, flipped it over and just eyeballed it. So my button measurements aren't accurate.
  * Used a 5/8 spade bit to cut the joystick hole
  * Used a 1 1/8 spade bit to cut the buttons

![1 1/8 Spade Bit](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181217_144101.jpg)
![Holes Cut](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/raspi-arcade/blob/master/pics/20181215_215323.jpg)

9. Now that the buttons are cut you using the dermal tool you need to shape the wood inserting a point to hold the joystick.

## Paint

Remove the traditional legs and paint all 4 plates both sides using the Semi-Gloss Glidden Red 2 coat Paint (GLN6413N).
